# Mobile-First Doctrine

All builds prioritize mobile as the primary experience. Visual hierarchy, spacing, typography, and CTA placement must be validated on mobile breakpoints before desktop refinement. Desktop is treated as an expanded adaptation of the mobile foundation — not the primary design canvas.

Going forward:

- Mobile is the standard of excellence.
- Desktop is the upscale extension.
- No feature, layout, or visual adjustment should optimize desktop at the expense of mobile clarity.
